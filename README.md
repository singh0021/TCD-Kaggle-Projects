# TCD-Kaggle-Projects

1. Kaggel_Linear_Regression_for_Income_data.ipynb:  refers to final solution in which models have been developed and tested.
2. Machine Learning Solution.ipynb notebook: specific to data visualization for feature selection. Though it has details for models but this notebook model results were not used for model. It is specific to plots amongst variables only.
3. Data.csv: Training data
4. tcdml2019-20incomepredictiontest(without labels).csv: testing data
5. tcd ml 2019-20 income prediction submission file.csv: submission file


Learning from this competition: Gradient Boost regression overfits model and may kill your testing data. Hence use it always carefully.
